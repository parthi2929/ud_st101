In raw tex files,

1. includegraphics shall not have any width as, its restricted by default in jupyter's preamble by a hardcoded value of 80%. If you still include, main build will fail
2. The float and crop options are to be specified in documentclass of main.tex just like they are in sub-files (along with more options like onesided for book type) else main build will fail.
3. As per standalone package rule, the sub-files should refer to main template. So do not create preamble, instead whatever you need, insert in myrawtex.sty, the common style file for raw tex.


In auto generated tex files from ipython notebook,

1. Remove the preamble, instead make it refer the style document created in template
2. In code cells, do not have any quotes inside comments.
3. In code cells, have short comments. The wrapped comments other than first line are again not hashed (to make it look like comment).
