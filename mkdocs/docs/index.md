# Intro To Statistics

It is compilation of my works on Udacity's [Intro To Statistics](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/st101) online course.  

<br>

I started as a backup of my notes, and answers for some of the questions, but soon discovered few topics needed a deep dive, so few pages are just Q&A, but few topics are dealt in detailed manner. Some of the topics are detailed so much that, it resulted in too many pages of explanation, so I exported them as pdfs, and presented in Dissertations section.  The section numbering is as per the course for easy reference.

**Dissertations:**  

I hope these detailed notes to serve as a strong foundation and refresher for me, in advanced topics later. I hope they are useful for you too.Especially in dissertations, I have taken huge pain in explaining every step of how the basic intuition is built upon a quest and the formula evolves. However, as I do this as a student learning the topic, few areas might not be pedagogically correct also. So please share your feedback if you find any issues.

**Target Audience:**  

The Disseration section would be helpful for any general audience who wish to refresh or learn the topics given. The rest would be mostly only be useful for those attending Udacity's Intro to Statistics course.
